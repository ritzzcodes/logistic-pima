Approximately 70% of problems in Data Science are classification problems. There are lots of classification problems that are available, but the logistics regression is common and is a useful regression method for solving the binary classification problem. Another category of classification is Multinomial classification, which handles the issues where multiple classes are present in the target variable. For example, IRIS dataset a very famous example of multi-class classification. Other examples are classifying article/blog/document category.\n","\n","Logistic Regression can be used for various classification problems such as spam detection.

It is easy to implement and can be used as the baseline for any binary classification problem. Its basic fundamental concepts are also constructive in deep learning.

Least Square Method**\n","The MLE is a \"likelihood\" maximization method, while OLS is a distance-minimizing approximation method. Maximizing the likelihood function determines the parameters that are most likely to produce the observed data. From a statistical point of view, MLE sets the mean and variance as parameters in determining the specific parametric values for a given model. This set of parameters can be used for predicting the data needed in a normal distribution.\n","\n","Ordinary Least squares estimates are computed by fitting a regression line on given data points that has the minimum sum of the squared deviations (least square error). Both are used to estimate the parameters of a linear regression model. MLE assumes a joint probability mass function, while OLS doesn't require any stochastic assumptions for minimizing distance.\n","\n","Sigmoid Function\n","The sigmoid function, also called logistic function gives an ‘S’ shaped curve that can take any real-valued number and map it into a value between 0 and 1. If the curve goes to positive infinity, y predicted will become 1, and if the curve goes to negative infinity, y predicted will become 0. If the output of the sigmoid function is more than 0.5, we can classify the outcome as 1 or YES, and if it is less than 0.5, we can classify it as 0 or NO.

In the output, 119 and 36 are actual predictions, and 26 and 11 are incorrect predictions.\n","\n","Visualizing Confusion Matrix using Heatmap\n","Let's visualize the results of the model in the form of a confusion matrix using matplotlib and seaborn.\n","\n","Here, you will visualize the confusion matrix using Heatmap."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"oBicNn3OQGJw"},"source":["# import required modules\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","import seaborn as sns\n","%matplotlib inline"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Nku99k9jQdU4"},"source":["class_names=[0,1] # name  of classes\n","fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n","tick_marks = np.arange(len(class_names))\n","plt.xticks(tick_marks, class_names)\n","plt.yticks(tick_marks, class_names)\n","# create heatmap\n","sns.heatmap(pd.DataFrame(cnf_matrix), annot=True, cmap=\"YlGnBu\" ,fmt='g')\n","ax.xaxis.set_label_position(\"top\")\n","plt.tight_layout()\n","plt.title('Confusion matrix', y=1.1)\n","plt.ylabel('Actual label')\n","plt.xlabel('Predicted label')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eUQbMuvJQl6U"},"source":["**Confusion Matrix Evaluation Metrics**\n","Let's evaluate the model using model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fV2PT4IcQnhD"},"source":["print(\"Accuracy:\",metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))\n","print(\"Precision:\",metrics.precision_score(y_test, y_pred))\n","print(\"Recall:\",metrics.recall_score(y_test, y_pred))"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kjIGH6YZQtCD"},"source":["Well, you got a classification rate of 80%, considered as good accuracy.\n","\n","**Precision:** Precision is about being precise, i.e., how accurate your model is. In other words, you can say, when a model makes a prediction, how often it is correct.

Also, it doesn't require scaling of features. Logistic regression provides a probability score for observations.\n","\n","**Disadvantages **\n","Logistic regression is not able to handle a large number of categorical features/variables. It is vulnerable to overfitting. Also, can't solve the non-linear problem with the logistic regression that is why it requires a transformation of non-linear features. Logistic regression will not perform well with independent variables that are not correlated to the target variable and are very similar or correlated to each other.\n","\n","**Conclusion**\n","In this tutorial, you covered a lot of details about Logistic Regression. You have learned what the logistic regression is, how to build respective models, how to visualize results and some of the theoretical background information. Also, you covered some basic concepts such as the sigmoid function, maximum likelihood, confusion matrix, ROC curve.\n","\n","Hopefully, you can now utilize the Logistic Regression technique to analyze your own datasets.
